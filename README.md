# Individual and Structural Graph Information Bottlenecks for Out-of-Distribution Generalization

Official Implementation for our TKDE paper [Individual and Structural Graph Information Bottlenecks for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](). This work focuses on distribution shifts on graph data (Graph OOD) for both graph- and node-level prediction tasks, and proposes a new method Individual and Structural Graph Information Bottlenecks (**IS-GIB**) for out-of-distribution generalization.

## Overview of IS-GIB
